# Launcher App

The Launcher App is the most trusted App in the user's App ecosystem. When Alice installs the Launcher App on her server, it allows her to add Apps to a preferred App list, keeps keys for each App, and signs tokens or [HTTP Sig headers](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/master/HttpSignature.md) for any App launched by the Launcher App in order to allow it to authenticate for a particular resource. As such it is at the center of Access Control and Authentication Logic in the browser.

In more detail, the App Launcher:
  * presents the various Apps a user likes to use in a user friendly way, makes it easy for a user to add new ones, and to launch them in a seperate frame.
  * For each App the user adds, it creates an AppID Document, containing an AppId that identifies the App instance as used by a particular user.
  * If needed it maintains the link chain from the user's WebID document to it, to allow access control rules that require users to authenticate via their App.
  * The AppID Document keeps metadata about the App:
	  * an icon to display to the user
     * where the source code of the App is located, by linking to an App Manifest, which should contain additional information such as who built the App, the issue database for it, etc...
	  * information about restrictions on where the App can authenticate to and what it can do 
  * It creates a local resource space (an LDPC) for each App to use and sets the initial access rights to that space
  * It plays the role of the keychain for each App, by creating public/private key pairs for each App securely, publishing the public key and managing links from the user's WebID to the App instance profiles. It can also play the role of an OpenID Connect proxy.
  
This proposal emerged out of [issue 45: User Controlled Authorization App and App Launcher](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/issues/45) 


# Description

The most important role of the launcher App is to allow apps to authenticate to remote Origins. Because it can launch other Apps in new Frames it can communicate with them securely using [Window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage). As it launches them it can sign headers and identify the App instance that is making the request. But because the App Launcher is signing the request, and not the App, it can speak for the App instance. If the App itself were to sign tokens, [it would not be possible for a resource server to distinguish between an App instance and any other](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/issues/18#issuecomment-534539775), since any key could be leaked by an App to its origin and beyond. By maintaining the keys, publishing public keys, and linking them to the users WebID, the App Launcher create an identity for a particular App instance. 

The key part of the Launcher App is enabled by [Window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API available in the browsers. This is illustrated in the following diagram:

![Launcher App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124506/66335877-3485bc00-e93c-11e9-9861-b19beefea18e.png)

This shows two Apps running side by side in the users' browser on her laptop. The left one is the App Launcher and the right one is a Calendaring App. (These are shown side by side to help describe the information flow in Red, not as a prescription for how the UI should be built). The App Laucher's Origin is alice's Freedom Box. The App to the right has for Origin an App server at `Apps.com`. We show the Calendar App wanting to communicate with Alice's friends Bob's server. Presumably after a 401 trying to access a resource on `bob.me` the following three steps occur:
1. the calendar App requests using [Window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) that the App launcher sign some headers or provide a token to authenticate for the given resource. 
2. the App Launcher verifies that the access is allowed and signs the headers in the [HTTP-Sig](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/master/HttpSignature.md) case or constructs a token for OpenID Connect.
3. The Calendar App sends the request with the required headers to `bob.me`.
 

In order to be able to develop some examples we put forward the following sketch of an ontology

```Turtle
solid:App a owl:Class;
   rdfs:comment """
	  An App Instance on a user's Pod, that contains links
	  to the source code, manifest, doc, ...
	  and links to the local preferences, public keys, 
	  space allocated for a pod, ...
	""".

solid:manifest a rdf:Property;
   rdfs:domain solid:App;
	rdfs:range solid:Manifest;
	rdfs:comment """
	   relates an App instance description in control of the user to the App Manifest, that contains links
		to its source, owners, ...
	""";
```


# Problems Solved

The Launcher App solves the following problems [identified by the Panel](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/blob/master/meetings/2019-10-09.md), see also [updated version in HackMD](https://hackmd.io/GeD5XLyzTG6WNHsxkOxqJA).

### Identifying the App Source & App Manifest

The App Launcher keeps track on the user's pod server
of links to the App Manifest (where we imagine where the source js is to be found)

For example a the App Laucher could create a document describing Calendar App by creating a resource containing the
following triples:

```Turtle
<#CalendarApp> a solid:App;
   solid:manifest <http://calendar.app/manifest>;
   solid:storage </apps/calendar/>;
   cert:key </keys/k42#> .
```

### Constraining the App 

The App launcher can keep information about desired restrictions on the app, placing those in a special file
that can access controlled for only App Launcher visibility if needed:

```Turtle
<#CalendarApp> a solid:App;
    solid:aclRestrictions <restrictions>;
```

Because all access tokens, or signatures go through the
LauncherApp it can refuse to give out such tokens, for
resources that do not meet the requirements.

### App asking for access to a specific resource

If the header of the resource that is not allowing access has a link to an ldp:Container to make such a request, then the App can make a request using the WebID of the App - the AppId. It can use the launcher App to sign such
a request (or the Launcher App could make the request itself on behalf of the launched app)

### App asking access for the user

Same as above but the request now contains the WebID of the user, or some way of identifying the user (say via 
a keyId URL).

### An App should be able to ask access to a kind of resource

Same as above, but in addition the App can specify
the type of resource it wants access to. This will
require changes to wACLs structure.

If we allow the wACLs to include other ACLs then the server can on accepting such
a request, create an wACL with the content

```Turtle
[] acl:accessToClass [ mime:type "photo/*" ];
   acl:mode acl:Read;
   acl:agent <https://user.me/apps/sPhoto#> .
```	

And include that, or a colletion of such files in each created acl. 
Inclusion is useful to avoid duplication of access control rules.

### Varying levels of sensitivity for resources

It would help here if the Launcher App was proxying the
requests as it could then be the intermediary that opens up a 
Pop-Up Box when a resource declares itself to be of
a certain type of sensitivity

## Additional Problems to be solved

### Access Control Policies

The Launcher App could be tuned for policies as to when
to automate the access control decisions, so as to avoid
overwhelming the user with pop up boxes asking for access to resources.
This would work especially well if the Launcher App proxies all HTTP requests.
The App Launcher would then contain a policy editor to make it easy to
set general policies.

### Identify the App

Because the App Launcher has a pointer to the App Manifest and launches the App 
according to that information it can have a well recognised way of 
identifying an App that is much more fine grained than
an HTTP Origin, namely by using the AppId.
 
# Use Cases

The Launcher App addresses the following use cases from the 
[Use Case Document](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/blob/master/UseCases.md).
We limit ourselves here to three use cases for the moment.

### Alice's Admin App

> Alice uses https://admin.example to control her pod
Admin wants to be able to read and write to all files on a userâ€™s Pod

This is the App we are calling the Launcher App. The first thing
it needs to do is to be copied to the Pod Owner's Origin in order to avoid leakage of public/private key pairs to other origins. Due to current limititions of rights given by browsers to apps with the same origin, the origin may even need to be a subdomain such as `safe.user.me`, for a pod at `user.me`. It can authenticate with a username/password, the user's WebID, or other methods. 

The Launcher App authenticating as the user is given administrative rights by editing an ACL. One way to do this is to allow ACLs 

1. to include other ACLs via an include statement
2. to allow acls to describe groups of resources using some form of regular expression based on [Powder](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-powder-primer-20090901/).

This would then require only one ACL to give the Admin App full rights such as with 

```Turtle
[] acl:accessToClass [ acl:matching "https://*.user.me/**" ];
   acl:mode acl:Read, acl:Write;
   acl:agent <https://safe.user.me/apps/admin#>;
```

Then if all acls automatically include this acl, all resources can automatically give access to the Admin App.

### Alice's Single Player Game

> Alice uses https://simplegame.example to play a singleplayer game
>   * Simplegame only needs some file somewhere that it can write its own configuration to. It does not care where it is
>   * Simpleapp will also need to access this file again even if itâ€™s being used on another machine


1. Alice discovers the new game at https://simplegame.example 
2. She Drags and Drops the URL onto her Launcher App (or een may have a browser button to do this), which then follows the procedure
    1. The Laucher App fetches the representation at the Link and receives a Manifest
    2. The Manifest describes the game, has an icon, links to the start page, describes window size, ... information the Launcher App uses to present the SinglePlayer App icon and metadata to the user.
	3. If the user requests for it to be added, the Launcher App - which is the most trusted App and comes from the Pod Owners' own Origin - and has access in read/write to the user's Pod, creates an LDPC in the appropriate place for the App to store its files.
	4. The Launcher App creates 
	   * a public/private key in the browser and publishes a description of that key in a KeyId Document somewhere
		* it publishes a document to an LDPC describing the Single Player Game with links to the manifest, html, a link to the public key, and whatever else is needed ... thereby giving the App instance for that user an AppId
		* Directly or indirectly there is a link from the user's WebID to AppId of the game instance
3. When Alice launches the Single Player App by clicking on its icon, the App Launcher opens a new window or frame with as startup link the URL for the html that starts the App, and information about where to send any messages using [Window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) and where to store its local state, which for the purpose of the SinglePlayer App can be a space with very limited access rights.
	* When the Single Player App wishes to create files in that space, it asks the Laucher App via Window.postMessage to sign a token or a set of HTTP headers to authenticate as that single player instance.
	* The App Launcher knowing which frame the Single Player App is in will know which private key to choose to sign the headers. It may also know that this App should only authenticate to that specific space, and so will not sign any headers for requests to other origins or resources that lie outside of the space allocated to it.
		

### Alice Social Photo App (sPhoto) 

> Alice uses https://decentPhotos.example to view her photos and her friend Bobâ€™s photos
>  * Decent photos wants to read to all photos on Aliceâ€™s Pod
>  * Wants to read all photos on Bobâ€™s Pod that Alice has access to

We extend this example to a friend group, as there is no reason not to make it scalable. 

After installation the Launcher/Admin App gives access to sPhoto to a subfolder structure where Alice stores her Photos. The Launcher App initially only signs requests for files in that URL space.

As Alice grows confident in the quality of the App she extends the permissions by using the Launcher App to edit any photos of members of a particular group by WebID, from which it can find the spaces in which photos are located. Whenever access control is required there the sPhoto sends a request to the Launcher App, 
which signs the tokens if allowed, without bothering Alice for authorization at each point.

We note here that if the Launcher App could control all the web connections (as would have been possible with [Foreign Fetch](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/foreign-fetch) this would give it a lot more control. Indeed there may be a lot to be gained by giving the Launcher App control over the RDF Quad store of all data found on the web. This would allow the sPhoto to search for any images in the database. In order to avoid leakages of information this would require functionality such as [COWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/COWL/) to be present in the browsers (see [COWL issue  80: What is the Status of COWL](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-cowl/issues/80).

If ever Alice sPhoto edits a photo outside of the well know space and needs Write Access to an external resource, the Launcher App gives it out but not before asking Alice for permission.


# Success Criteria

The Launcher App can be evaluated against the [Success Criteria](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel) identified by the panel.


#### The system is not abusable

More criteria on how to evaluate abuse are needed.

#### An App can request access to a specific resource

presumably a protected one.
Yes, it can ask the Launcher App for a signature, which can 
decide according to policies whether to sign or not.

#### An App can request access to a specific type of data without knowing the structure of resources on a Pod

yes, if given a URL it can make a request on it.
If that resource does not give access then a protocol for adding a user to a request is needed.
That request can be signed by the Launcher App.

#### Access requests can be sent when the resource owner is not present to be approved once the user is present

This is not a proposal for Access Requests. 
It can work with one though.

#### Apps can request the ability to write a specific type of data and will be told where it should write it

The Launcher App gives space to the client to store it's config and other data.
Resources found by following links can also describe how and where certain changes can  be made.

#### It should be possible for an agent to block/allow certain apps from accessing a specific resource as that agent

Either the Resource Server blocks the App because it does not provide the right credentials, or the App Launcher refuses to sign because the App is requesting access to content which are in the disallowed resource space.

#### It should be possible for an agent with Control access to block/allow certain apps from accessing a specific resource as any agent

Yes, the Launcher App (a.k.a Admin App) can do that as it controls the authentication keys for each App.

#### It should be easy to allow others accessing your resources to use apps you're okay without requiring your explicit consent.

Because the Launcher App allows Apps to be identified more closely to the user, this makes it possible for 
wACLs to authorise users rather than apps. Restrictions in wACLs can be placed, to allowing only specific user-apps,
but that reduces the fluidity of cooperation, and creates an administration cost on the user. 

#### Access to specific types of data should extend to new resources that contain that data

An wACL for an agent could be 

```Turtle
[] acl:accessToClass [ mime:type "photo/*" ];
   acl:mode acl:Read;
   acl:agent <https://user.me/apps/sPhoto#> .
```	

And this could be referenced or included from any wACL for any
resource that wants to follow those rules.

#### Access to specific types of data should not expose other data that was not requested

It is too early in the life cycle of this proposal for this to be determined.

#### Data should have different levels of requirements for user's conciousness in consent

If a `Link` header can specify this level of consent it can be made available to the Launcher app, that can then
ask the user before signing an access token or header.
